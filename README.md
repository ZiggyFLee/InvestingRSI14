# InvestingRSI14

This repo is a dump of .ipynb files I created using AI (quality maybe not the best). It is a quick exploration of the value of using the RSI 14 as an indicator for entry points in long term investing.

With the S&P500 RSI 14 crossing 70 recently, I was asking myself if this indicator carried any weight long-term. My intuition told me that since the indicator tells us whether a market is over-bought/sold, aligning your investment strategy with this indicator would be a no-brainer.

To test this hypothesis I made some notebooks which compared the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd order RSI's with a simple investing strategy.

## Methodology:
The simple strategy invests in the S&P500 at a rate of $100/week no matter what.
For the RSI strategies, the investor saves their $100/week in cash until the indicator hits their desired level, at which point they will buy into the S&P500. The investor will continue to do so until the indicator crosses the threshold and is no longer favorable.

## Results:
Time in the market > Timing the market.

Even when this strategy did beat the simple investing strategy, it was not significant.
